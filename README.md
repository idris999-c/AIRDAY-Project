### Table of Contents?
For my AIRDAY project, it basically contains sidebar, calendar and weather. It is an airday project where I gather basic needs such as weather and calendar together.
#
### What purpose does it serve?
Our aim is for people to equip themselves in a prepared way according to the conditions of the weather during the day and to create their own timetable according to the days of the day, month or even year in the calendar. We, as the AİRDAY project, take into account these two basic needs and facilitate the needs of people by bringing these two together. 
#
### How to operate it?
When you come to the home page of the AIRDAY project, by clicking on the calendar, you will come to the calendar page, where there is a simple structure and you will see the days of the month and you will see the month, week and day as seen at the top right, where you can write your own daily or weekly schedules.   
#
### How was it done?
Our project is an artificial intelligence project developed by ChatGPT. It includes HTML, CSS and JavaScripts.
#
### How to get data?
We offer you instant data by accessing the data by OpenWeatherMap. As a member of OpenWeatherMap, you can get your “API key” password.
